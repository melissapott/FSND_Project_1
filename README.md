#Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailers
This program was produced as a project submission for Udacity's Full Stack Developer Nanodegree program.  This program will
display a list of movies in an html page, show trailers of the movies, and display information about the movies.

##Requirements
- a web browser such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) must be installed
- The following files included in this repository (should be installed in the same directory)
  - **entertainment_center.py** - *this file contains the list of movies, their data points, and calls a function that creates the webpage to display them*
  - **media.py** - *this file contains the class definition for Movie*
  - **fresh_tomatoes.py** - *this file generates the html page*
  - **imdb.png** - *this is an image used on the html page*

##Usage
1.  Make sure that Python is installed, and all the required files are stored in the same directory
2.  Run 'entertainment_center.py' from [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html) or on command line.
3.  A web browser should open displaying various movie poster images.  Clicking on the images should play a trailer of
the movie.  
4.  Clicking on the 'More Info' button should open a modal dialog displaying information about the movie and a link to the movie at IMDB

##Notes
- 'fresh_tomatoes.py' as found [here](https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py) was provided
as starter code.  I have noted in comments in the file where I have changed, removed, or added code from what
was originally provided.  The files 'entertainment_center.py' and 'media.py' were created as part of the Udacity curriculm.
